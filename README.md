# Webpage Frontend Refactor

## Description

This is a refactor of an existing website with the goal of improving its accessibility and search engine optimization. The website was originally created with outdated HTML and CSS, so the refactor updates the code to use modern best practices.

Examples of these improvements include:
- replacing excessive use of &lt;div&gt; elements with appropriate semantic elements
- addition of descriptive alt texts for all &lt;img&gt; elements on the page
- updating header hierarchy to align with informational hierarchy

Appropriate updates were made to corresponding CSS to ensure styling remained consistent after HTML refactor.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS

## Installation
This is a webpage, so nothing is required to access beyond a modern browser capable of rendering standard webpages

## Usage
It's a webpage; you look at it, and maybe click one of the three links in the nav bar.
